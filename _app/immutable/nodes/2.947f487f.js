            manager for the node js runtime environment, was installed. Since my development machine 
            is a mac, I used homebrew to install node via the command &#39;brew install node&#39;. To install 
            svelte, I ran the command: &#39;npm create svelte@latest lab10c&#39;. I was then taken through a 
            set of prompts in the terminal such as whether or not to create my app using typescript,
            what build tool to use, etc. To build the page, I went to the routes folder that was
            generated by the previous script, and then coded from the &#39;+page.svelte&#39; file, which
            is the page for the base route of the app.</p></section> <section class="svelte-eby1hm"><h2 class="svelte-eby1hm">Challenges</h2> <p class="svelte-eby1hm">I&#39;ve used many web-frameworks in the past for personal and company projects, so the overall
            process of learning how to use svelte was fairly straightforward. One small difficulty I faced
            however, was getting used to the folder structure of the framework as well as figuring out the
            entrypoint to the application. I was able to remediate this problem by tracing through
            all the files, figuring out what the purpose of each one was, and then consulting the
            <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/basic-markup" class="svelte-eby1hm">documentation</a> whenever I was unsure on a 
            particular file or component.</p></section>`;return{c(){e=i("div"),e.innerHTML=a,this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(e)!=="svelte-1hjxaxk"&&(e.innerHTML=a),this.h()},h(){p(e,"class","svelte-eby1hm")},m(t,n){u(t,e,n)},p:s,i:s,o:s,d(t){t&&d(e)}}}class w extends r{constructor(e){super(),h(this,e,null,f,l,{})}}export{w as component};
